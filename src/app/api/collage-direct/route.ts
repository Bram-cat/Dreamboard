${
  hasSelfie
    ? `
FACIAL CONSISTENCY IS THE #1 PRIORITY - MORE IMPORTANT THAN ANYTHING ELSE!

The FIRST reference image shows the EXACT person who this vision board belongs to.

STEP-BY-STEP REQUIREMENTS FOR EVERY PHOTO WITH A PERSON:

1Ô∏è‚É£ STUDY THE REFERENCE PHOTO CAREFULLY:
   - Memorize the person's EXACT facial features before generating any photos
   - This is the TEMPLATE - every person photo must match this EXACTLY

2Ô∏è‚É£ COPY THESE EXACT FEATURES TO EVERY PHOTO WITH A PERSON:
   ‚úì EXACT same face shape and bone structure
   ‚úì EXACT same skin tone (shade, undertone, complexion)
   ‚úì EXACT same eyes (shape, color, eyebrow shape)
   ‚úì EXACT same nose (shape, size, nostril shape)
   ‚úì EXACT same mouth (lip shape, smile, teeth)
   ‚úì EXACT same hair (color, texture, style)
   ‚úì EXACT same jawline, cheekbones, forehead
   ‚úì Person must be IMMEDIATELY recognizable as the same individual

3Ô∏è‚É£ FORBIDDEN - NEVER DO THIS:
   ‚úó NO inventing new facial features
   ‚úó NO generic/stock photo faces
   ‚úó NO "similar looking" people
   ‚úó NO different faces in different photos
   ‚úó NO AI-generated random faces
   ‚úó NO approximations - must be EXACT match

4Ô∏è‚É£ QUALITY CHECK BEFORE EACH PHOTO:
   Ask: "Does this person's face EXACTLY match the reference photo?"
   - If NO ‚Üí Remove person, show only the scene/objects
   - If MAYBE ‚Üí Remove person, not good enough
   - If YES, PERFECT MATCH ‚Üí Keep the photo

5Ô∏è‚É£ PRIORITY:
   - Better to have 4 photos with PERFECT facial match
   - Than 10 photos with slightly different faces
   - The user WILL immediately notice any facial variation

REMEMBER: This person is creating a vision board of THEMSELVES. They know their own face PERFECTLY. Any slight variation will be instantly noticed and the board will be unusable.`

üõë BETTER TO HAVE 5 PERFECT QUOTES THAN 12 BROKEN/MISSPELLED ONES

FACIAL CONSISTENCY:
${
  hasSelfie
    ? `- ABSOLUTE FACIAL CONSISTENCY: Every person must be the EXACT SAME individual from reference photo
- Same face, skin tone, features, hair style across ALL photos showing the person
- If you cannot maintain perfect facial consistency, show the scene without a person
- Better to show object/scene only than to show wrong person
- NO random stock photos, NO generic people - ONLY use reference photo person`
    : "- NO random people if no selfie provided"
}

VISUAL QUALITY:
- Consistent car/house identity throughout (match reference images exactly)
- Visual variety: different poses, settings, outfits, but SAME person
- Sharp focus, professional photography quality
- Appropriate spacing and overlap for ${selectedStyle} style
- Natural lighting, warm tones, magazine-quality composition

PRIMARY GOALS TO VISUALIZE: ${goals}

REMEMBER: This is a PERSONAL vision board for ONE specific person. Every human face must be recognizably the same individual from the first reference image. Facial consistency is MORE IMPORTANT than quantity - show fewer photos of the person if needed to maintain perfect consistency.`;
